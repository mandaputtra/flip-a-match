Simple game to find matching colors. Want to help develop it? Here's how!

## Contributing

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Let's get you set up to contribute:

**Requirements:**

* **Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en):** This is the foundation for running the project.
* **Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads):** This is a version control system for tracking changes in your code.
* **pnpm (https://pnpm.io/):** This is a package manager for installing project dependencies.

**Development Process:**

1. **Clone the Repository:** Get a copy of the project's code on your machine using Git. `git clone https://github.com/mandaputtra/flip-a-match`
2. **Install Dependencies:** Once cloned, navigate to the project directory and run `pnpm install` in your terminal to install all the necessary tools the project uses.
3. **Run the App:** With dependencies installed, you can start the development server by running `pnpm dev` in your terminal. This will launch the game in your browser, ready for testing and development.

**Deployment:**

Ready to share your creation with the world? Here's how to deploy:

1. **Build for Deployment:** Run `pnpm build` in your terminal. This creates an optimized `dist` folder containing the production-ready files.
2. **Host on Netlify:** Drag and drop the `dist` folder to Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/) for a quick and easy deployment option. Alternatively, you can use any static site hosting platform of your choice.
